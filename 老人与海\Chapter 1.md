He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled（盘绕的） lines or the gaff and harpoon（鱼叉） and the sail（帆） that was furled（卷起） around the mast（桅杆）. The sail was patched with flour sacks and， furled, it looked like the flag of permanent（永久的） defeat.

他是个独自在湾流的一条小船上打鱼的老人，他已经有整整八十四天没有钓到鱼了。在头四十天还有个小孩跟随着他，但是过了四十天还是没有钓到一条鱼，小男孩的父母对他说，老人如今一定是倒霉透顶，并且在父母的吩咐下，小男孩到另一条船上捕鱼，这艘船在第一周就抓到了三条好鱼。看到老人每次空船而归，小男孩总是感到很难受，他常常跑下去帮助老人搬运盘绕的绳子或者鱼钩和鱼叉，还有绕在桅杆上的帆。帆布被面粉袋打了些补丁，当被卷起来时，看起来就像永远失败的旗帜。



salao 是西班牙语,正确的拼写应为salado,意为加了盐的,咸的,苦的,转义为倒霉的、不吉利的
