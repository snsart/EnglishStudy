He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and， furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.

他是个独自在湾流的一条小船上打鱼的老人，他已经有整整八十四天没有钓到鱼了。在头四十天还有个小孩跟随着他，但是过了四十天还是没有钓到一条鱼，小男孩的父母对他说，老人如今一定是倒霉透顶，并且在父母的吩咐下，小男孩到另一条船上捕鱼，这艘船在第一周就抓到了三条好鱼。看到老人每次空船而归，小男孩总是感到很难受，他常常跑下去帮助老人搬运盘绕的绳子或者鱼钩和鱼叉，还有绕在桅杆上的帆。帆布被面粉袋打了些补丁，当被卷起来时，看起来就像永远失败的旗帜。

The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.

老人消瘦而憔悴，在他的脖子后面有深深的皱纹。在他的面颊上有棕色的斑点，这是热带海洋反射出的光线造成的良性皮肤癌。斑褐从他脸的两侧一直蔓延下来。他的双手常用绳索拉大鱼，留下了很深的伤疤。但是这些伤疤中没有一块是新的。它们像无鱼可打的沙漠中被侵蚀的地方一般古老。

Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated.

他身上的一切都显得古老，除了那双眼睛，它们像海水一样蓝，是愉快而不肯认输的。

“Santiago,“ the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was hauled up. “I could go with you again. We’ve made some money.“

“圣地亚哥，”他们俩从小船停泊的地方爬上岸时，孩子对他说：“我又能陪你一起出海了，我们家赚了点钱。”

The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.

 老人教会了孩子捕鱼，孩子爱他。
 
“No,“ the old man said. “You’re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.“

“不”老人说：“你遇上了条幸运的船，你应该跟着他们”

“But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big ones every day for three weeks.“

“但是你记得吗？你曾经有连续八十七天钓不到一条鱼，跟着三个礼拜，我们每天都钓到了大鱼。”

“I remember,“ the old man said. “I know you did not leave me because you doubted.“

 “我记得，”老人说：“我知道你不是因为没把握才离开我的”

“It was papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him.“

 “是爸爸叫我走的。我是个孩子，不能不听从他。”

“I know,“ the old man said. “It is quite normal.”

 “我知道，”老人说。“这很正常。”

“He hasn’t much faith.”

“他没有多大的信心。”

“No,“ the old man said. “But we have. Haven’t we?”

“是啊，”老人说。“可是我们有，不是吗？”

“Yes,“ the boy said. “Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we’ll take the stuff home.“

“是的”小男孩说：“我请你到露台饭店去喝杯啤酒，然后一起把打鱼的家什带回去。”　

“Why not?“ the old man said. “Between fishermen.“

“那敢情好，”老人说。“都是打鱼人嘛。”

They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was not angry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But they did not show it and they spoke politely（有礼貌地） about the current（现在的，电流，水流） and the depths they had drifted（漂流） their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen. The successful fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered（屠宰的） their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks（木板）, with two men staggering（惊人的，蹒跚(stagger的现在分词)） at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck（卡车） to carry them to the market in Havana（哈瓦那）. Those who had caught sharks（鲨鱼） had taken them to the shark factory on the other side of the cove（小海湾） where they were hoisted（吊起的） on a block and tackle, their livers（肝脏）removed, their fins（鱼鳍） cut off and their hides skinned（剥皮的） out and their flesh（肉）cut into strips（条状物） for salting（腌制）.

他们坐在露天饭店，许多渔民都拿老人取乐，但是老人一点都不生气。其他老一点的渔民，看着他都会感到难过。但是他们都没有显露出来，只是斯文的谈起海流，谈起他们把钓索送到海面下有多深，天气一贯多好以及他们的见闻。当天打鱼得手的渔夫都已回来，把大马林鱼剖开，整片儿排在两块木板上，每块木板的一端由两个人抬着，摇摇晃晃地送到收鱼站，在哪里等冷藏车来把它们送到哈瓦耶市场。逮到鲨鱼的人把它们送到海湾另一边的鲨鱼加工工厂，吊在复合滑车上，除去肝脏，割去鱼鳍，剥去外皮，把肉切成条状腌制。

> block and tackle（滑轮）
> tackle(用具，装备;索具;)

“Santiago,“ the boy said.

“圣地亚哥，”这个男孩说道。

“Yes,“ the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago.

“是的”老人说。他正握着酒杯思考好多年以前的事。

“Can I go out to get sardines（沙丁鱼） for you for tomorrow?“

“要我去弄点沙丁鱼来给你明天用吗？”
　　
“No. Go and play baseball. I can still row（划船，行） and Rogelio will throw the net.“

“不了。去玩棒球吧。我划船还行，罗赫略会给我撒网的。”

“I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you, I would like to serve in some way.“

“我很想去。即使不能陪你钓鱼，我也能为你做点其他的事”

“You bought me a beer,“ the old man said. “You are already a man.“
　
“你请我喝了杯啤酒，”老人说。“你已经是个大人了。”　

“How old was I when you first took me in a boat?”

“你头一回带我上船，我有多大？”

“Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green（绿色的，青春的） and he nearly tore（撕下）the boat to pieces. Can you remember?”

五岁，那天我把一条鲜龙活跳的鱼拖上船去，它差一点把船撞得粉碎，你也差一点给送了命。还记得吗？”

#### 2018.8.14

“I can remember the tail slapping（拍打） and banging and the thwart（阻挠，独木舟的横梁） breaking and the noise of the clubbing（杵臼）. I can remember you throwing me into the bow（弓;鞠躬;船头） where the wet（潮湿的） coiled lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver（颤抖） and the noise of you clubbing him like chopping（砍;剁） a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me.“

“我记得鱼尾巴砰砰地拍打着，船上的座板给打断了，还有棍子打鱼的声音。我记得你把我朝船头猛推，那儿搁着湿漉漉的钓索卷儿，我感到整条船在颤抖，听到你啪啪地用棍子打鱼的声音，象有砍一棵树，还记得我浑身上下都是甜丝丝的血腥味儿。”
　　
“Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?“

“你当真记得那回事儿，还是我不久前刚跟你说过？”

“I remember everything from when we first went together.“

“打从我们头一回一起出海时起，什么事儿我都记得清清楚楚。”

The old man looked at him with his sun-burned（日灼的）, confident（自信的） loving eyes.

老人用他那双常遭日晒而目光坚定的眼睛爱怜地望着他。

“If you were my boy I’d take you out and gamble（赌博）,“ he said. “But you are your father’s and your mother’s and you are in a lucky boat.“

“如果你是我自己的小子，我准会带你出去闯一下，”他说。“可你是你爸爸和你妈妈的小子，你搭的又是一条交上了好运的船。”

“May I get the sardines? I know where I can get four baits（诱饵） too.“

“我去弄沙丁鱼来好吗？我还知道上哪儿去弄四条鱼饵来。”

“I have mine left from today. I put them in salt in the box.“

“我今天还有自个儿剩下的。我把它们放在匣子里腌了。”

“Let me get four fresh ones.“

“让我给你弄四条新鲜的来吧。”

“One,“ the old man said. His hope and his confidence had never gone. But now they were freshening（保鲜） as when the breeze（微风） rises.

“一条，”老人说。他的希望和信心从没消失过。现在可又象微风初起时那么清新了。

“Two,“ the boy said.

“两条，”孩子说。

“Two,“ the old man agreed. “You didn’t steal them?“

“就两条吧，”老人同意了。“你不是去偷的吧？”

“I would,“ the boy said. “But I bought these.“

“我愿意去偷，”孩子说。“不过这些是买来的。”

#### 2018.8.15

“Thank you,” the old man said. He was too simple to wonder when he had attained（达到） humility（谦卑）. But he knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful（可耻的） and it carried no loss of true pride.

“谢谢，”老人说。他心地单纯，不去琢磨什么时候他已经变得如此谦卑。但是他知道他达到了，知道这并不丢脸，所以也无损于真正的自尊心。

“Tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current,“ he said.

“看这海流，明天会是个好天气，”他说。

“Where are you going?“ the boy asked.

“明天你会去哪儿？”男孩问。

“Far out to come in when the wind shifts. I want to be out before it is light.“

“驶向远方，等风转向了再回来，我想在天亮前就出发。”

“I’ll try to get him to work far out,“ the boy said. “Then if you hook something truly big we can come to your aid.“

“我要想法叫船主人也驶向远方，”男孩说。“这样当你确实抓到了大鱼，我们能赶过去帮你。”

“He does not like to work too far out.“

“他不喜欢到很远的地方。”

“No,“ the boy said. “But I will see something that he cannot see such as a bird working and get him to come out after dolphin（海豚）.“

“是啊，”男孩说。“但是我会看到一些他看不见的东西，比如一只小鸟在空中盘旋，我就会叫他赶过去追赶海豚。”

“Are his eyes that bad?“

“他的眼睛这么不行吗？”

“He is almost blind.“

“简直是个瞎子。”

“It is strange,“ the old man said. “He never went turtle-ing（龟鳖）. That is what kills the eyes.“

“这很奇怪，”老人说。“他从没有捕过海豚。这玩意儿才伤眼睛呢。”

“But you went turtle-ing for years off the Mosquito（蚊子） Coast（海岸） and your eyes are good.“

“你可在莫斯基托海岸外捕了好多年海龟，你的眼力还是挺好的嘛。”

“I am a strange old man.“

“我是个不同寻常的老头子。”

“But are you strong enough now for a truly big fish?“

“但是你现在还有力气对付一条真正的大鱼吗？”

“I think so. And there are many tricks（技巧）.“

“我想可以。再说有不少窍门可用呢。”

“Let us take the stuff home,“ the boy said. “So I can get the cast（铸造;投射） net and go after the sardines.“

“让我们把这些家什带回家吧，”男孩说。“这样我就能拿了鱼网去捕沙丁鱼。”

They picked up the gear（齿轮） from the boat. The old man carried the mast（桅杆） on his shoulder and the boy carried the wooden box with the coiled, hard-braided（硬编织） brown lines, the gaff and the harpoon with its shaft（轴，给…装上杆柄）. The box with the baits was under the stern（船尾） of the skiff along with（除…以外还） the club（大棒;棍棒） that was used to subdue（征服） the big fish when they were brought alongside. No one would steal from the old man but it was better to take the sail and the heavy lines home as the dew（露水） was bad for them and, though he was quite sure no local people would steal from him, the old man thought that a gaff and a harpoon were needless（不必要的） temptations（诱惑） to leave in a boat.

他们从船上拿起打鱼的家什。老人把桅杆扛在肩上，孩子拿着内放编的很紧的褐色钓索卷的木箱、鱼钩和带杆子的鱼叉。盛鱼饵的匣子给藏在小船的船稍下面，哪儿还有一根在大鱼被拖到岸边时用来制服它们的棍子。谁也不会来偷老人的东西，但是还是把哪些帆和粗钓索带回家去的好，因为露水对这些东西不利，再说，尽管老人确信当地人不会来偷他的东西，但他认为把鱼钩和鱼叉留在船上实在是不必要的引诱。
